**Subject: Notice Regarding Yui Discord Bot Code**

Dear User,

I wanted to provide a brief note regarding the Yui Discord bot, which was developed by (myself)[https://github.com/LennSyntax] and (vladlen-codes)[https://github.com/vladlen-codes] on December 10th, 2020. At its peak, Yui was used in over 30,000 servers on Discord. However, due to issues surrounding YouTube's Terms of Service, particularly regarding the use of Lavalink and its violation of policies, we made the decision to take the bot offline.

This code represents the last version of Yui before its shutdown. While this version is not the original, it should provide a basic understanding of how the bot worked. Please note that we do not authorize the use of this code on Discord servers, nor should it be used for any commercial purposes.

Furthermore, we will not be responsible for any damage, issues, or consequences that arise from running or using this code.

Thank you for your understanding, and we kindly ask that you respect these guidelines.

Best regards,  
(LennSyntax)[https://github.com/LennSyntax] and (vladlen-codes)[https://github.com/vladlen-codes]
